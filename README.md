2 Overall DescriptionOverall Description
2.1 Product Overview
Application connect to database. After that application edit / see database variable. It means application is kind of Microsoft Structured Query Language Server Management Studio. Application name is KFAU Management System because I create database and I code application for this database. Application can insert / delete / see / update database variable. Application also check view table and procedure structure. If we keep on disadvantages, they are it cannot create table, it cannot separate view table and table and it cannot shows trigger.
2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
Using can be complicated sometimes. User have to click row number, not to click all row variables. User can be sure this. In connection tab, user be sure to there is no space end / start of server / database name. The others application directs user to using. In inserting or updating, if application give error, it can means there is an assertion.

3 Specific RequirementsSpecific Requirements
3.1 External Interface Requirements
3.1.1 User Interfaces
Application has got two interfaces. First is connection interface. User should write server name and database name. After writing, user can click connect button. Second is information interface. User see all table and their variables in there. User editing table in there easily. Application direct user to using. If there is an error application give information to user about error type. User can understand error and control it.
3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
User must have any database for using this program. If there is no database, that time application is over there.
3.1.3 Software Interfaces
User must installation some packages. They are python programming language, mssql, pyqt5 and pypyodbc.
3.2 Functional Requirements
3.2.1 Application Design
Application is programmed for object oriented programming method. So readability can be high for that. Application can improve by another programmer for readability is high.
3.2.2 Graphical User Interface Design
GUI is designed with QT Designer. QT Designer is very useful for this project. All widgets are tried for this project. QT Designer saves interface to .ui files. It can be convert python file (.py) with command line.

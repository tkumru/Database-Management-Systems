# Database-Management-Systems
 **GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES WITH DATABASE**

**1) Introduction**

  * Purpose

      Report show us Database Management System is what, its purpose is what and its features.

  * Product Scope

    Database Management System is independent application. Actual purpose is see data about university but application can connect any database and analyse any database. Benefits    are connection of any database, infinite select statement, infinite insert statement, infinite delete statement, infinite update statement and see view tables and procedure  stores.

**2) Overall DescriptionOverall Description**

  * Product Overview

      Application connect to database. After that application edit / see database variable. It means application is kind of Microsoft Structured Query Language Server Management  Studio. Application name is Database Management System because I create database and I code application for this database. Application can insert / delete / see / update         database variable. Application also check view table and procedure structure. If we keep on disadvantages, they are it cannot create table, it cannot separate view table and table and it cannot shows trigger.

  * Assumptions and Dependencies

      Using can be complicated sometimes. User have to click row number, not to click all row variables. User can be sure this. In connection tab, user be sure to there is no space end / start of server / database name. The others application directs user to using. In inserting or updating, if application give error, it can means there is an assertion.

**3) Specific RequirementsSpecific Requirements**

  * External Interface Requirements

    - Hardware Interfaces

      User must have any database for using this program. If there is no database, that time application is over there.

    - Software Interfaces

      User must installation some packages. They are python programming language, mssql, pyqt5 and pypyodbc.

  * Functional Requirements

      - Application Design

        Application is programmed for object oriented programming method. So readability can be high for that. Application can improve by another programmer for readability is high.

      - Graphical User Interface Design
        GUI is designed with QT Designer. QT Designer is very useful for this project. All widgets are tried for this project. QT Designer saves interface to .ui files. It can be convert python file (.py) with command line.
